And in this case we set the digestAlgorithm as whatever digest is used internally to ML-DSA.\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhen signing with Ed448, the\r\ndigestAlgorithm MUST be id-shake256, and the algorithm parameters\r\nfield MUST be absent.\r\n\r\n  NOTE: Either id-sha512 or id-shake256 is used as part to the\r\n  private key signing operation.  However, the private key signing\r\n  operation does not take a message digest computed with one of\r\n  these algorithms as an input.\r\n```",

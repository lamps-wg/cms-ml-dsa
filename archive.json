There are mitigations that can be applied in the interim for the EUF-CMA issue (e.g. only accepting one of signed attributes/no signed attributes, not both), so it's not like implementers have no options if they're worried about it prior to a separate RFC addressing the problem.\r\n\r\nI'm happy with the text you've suggested - it could be worth noting the issue in the Security Considerations perhaps, and that future CMS RFCs may address this. On the other hand, I guess it's not an issue that's specific to ML-DSA.\r\n",

Alternatively, something like \"the subjectPublicKey BIT STRING contains the raw octet string encoding of the public key, i.e. without any additional ASN.1 wrapping\". I do think it makes sense as currently written, it just took me a second read to check that the lack of capital letters was deliberate.",
